# purescript-cip30-mock

This repository contains a mock implementation for the Cardano Cip30 Wallet
interface, written in PureScript. The mock can be used for testing purposes to
simulate a wallet without needing to interact with an actual Cardano wallet.

This package is used in [cardano-transaction-lib](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib).
